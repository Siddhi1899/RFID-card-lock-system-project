# RFID-card-lock-system-project


    In this project, we are going to build an RFID based Access Control System using 8051 Micro Controller. RFID based security systems are very common in offices and universities.
    We are making the Project to emulate such systems using an 8051 Micro Controller with assembly language. For an RFID based door lock to work, we need to enroll a few “Allowed” RFIDs to be able to enter and block any other RFIDs.
    Software used is Proteus.
    RFID reader and tag. The RFID reader sends a pulse of radio waves to the tags and listens for its response. The RFID tag is primarily a kind of a memory device that can transmit its contents when being scanned by the reader. The EM-18 module RFID reader and tags are used.
    In conclusion, the objective to build an RFID based Door Lock System was successfully achieved. Overall in this system the term of performance and efficiency, has provided a very convenient method for security system or attendance marking system. This system is also user-friendly system as data manipulation & retrieval can be done via the interface making security system or attendance marking system.
